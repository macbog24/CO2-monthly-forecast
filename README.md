Final project for STOR 556 - Advanced Methods of Data Analysis

Carbon dioxide levels have been fluctuating for centuries, but the human activities of recent decades have caused an increase in CO2 ppm levels beyond the “safe” carbon dioxide concentration level of 350 ppm (Bassett). In addition to manmade causes of CO2 increases, such as burning of fossil fuels, natural events like el Niño cause increases in CO2 rates by producing droughts, which lead to stressed vegetation and reduced photosynthesis, so less CO2 is absorbed. Additionally, many plants are killed off during severe droughts, which also contributes to higher CO2 levels (Wolter). Many methods have been used to measure CO2 levels; however, the most well renowned is the Keeling Curve, a graph that plots the CO2 change in concentration and, thus far, shows an increase since the 1950s (Monroe). In this paper, we will create a model to predict CO2 levels for April, 2018 using least-squares regression, the ARMA process, and tests of randomness.
